# What Is HTML? ðŸ¤”

HyperText Markup Language is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. A language that defines the structure of your content. Can be used to make your content appear a certain way using elements.

> Note:  It is frequently assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

## HTML Element Structure

1. **The Opening Tag** - The name of the element. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.

>Ex: <> This is an opening tag.

2. **The Content** - Text that describes the content.

>Ex: potato

3. **The Closing Tag** - This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends.

>Ex: </> This is a closing tag.

**The Element** - The opening tag, the content, and the closing tag are what comprise an element.

>Ex: < h1 > potato</ h1> (no spaces)
