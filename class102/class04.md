# What Is HTML? ðŸ¤”

HyperText Markup Language is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. A language that defines the structure of your content. Can be used to make your content appear a certain way using elements.

> Note:  It is frequently assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

## HTML Element Structure

**The Opening Tag** - The name of the element. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.

>Ex: <> This is an opening tag.

**The Content** - Text that describes the content.

>Ex: potato

**The Closing Tag** - This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends.

>Ex: </> This is a closing tag.

**The Element** - The opening tag, the content, and the closing tag are what comprise an element.

>Ex: < h1 > potato</ h1> (no spaces)

## Giving HTML Elements Additional Information

We can give HTML elements additional information by using **Attributes**. Attributes do not appear in the actual content.

> Note: Attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it.
