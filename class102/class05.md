## Three Ways To Insert CSS

There are three ways to insert CSS into your document.

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS

## External CSS

You can change the look of an entire website by using one file.

> Note: Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file. The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

> Ex: (no spaces) < link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

## Internal CSS

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

> Note: The internal style is defined inside the < style> (no spaces) element, inside the head section.

> Ex: (no spaces) < style>
body {
    background-color: red;
}

## Inline CSS

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

> Note: To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

> Ex: (no spaces) < h1 style="color:blue;>< /h1>

## Example CSS rule

> Ex: Make all paragraph elements text color red.
<br>p {color: red;
}
