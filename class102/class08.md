# Operators And Loops

## Assignment Operators

Assigns a value to its left **operand** based on the value of its right **operand**.

> Note: An operand is the part of an instruction representing the data manipulated by the operator. For example, when you add two numbers, the numbers are the operand and "+" is the operator.

## Comparison Operators

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
