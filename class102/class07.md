# Programming With JavaScript

## Control Flow

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

> The **control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

> Control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.

## Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" **calls** it.

> Ex: function myFunction(p1, p2) {return p1 * p2;}

### Function Syntax

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

The parentheses may include parameter(**arguments**) names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}.

> Note: Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

> Ex: function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
code to be executed
}.

## Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when something invokes or **calls** the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button).
- When it is invoked **called** from JavaScript code.
- Automatically (self invoked).

## Operators

**Assigns** a value to a variable using (=).
