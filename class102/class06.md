# JavaScript

## What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a well-known scripting language for web pages, and many non-browser environments.

> Note: JavaScript is **NOT** Java. They have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

## Variables

Ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

- using **var**
- using **let**
- using **const**
- using nothing

What are Variables?

> Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

>Ex: x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:<br>
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

## When to Use JavaScript const?

> Note: **const** = constant. These are constant values and cannot be changed.

If you want a general rule: always declare variables with **const**.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use **let**.

## JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called **identifiers**.

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

> Note: JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

## The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

> Note: The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

> Assigns a value to a variable.

## Declaring a JavaScript Variable

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword.

## Information Received From The User

The information that is received from a user is called **input**.
