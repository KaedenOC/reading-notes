# Links, Layouts, and Functions

## Creating Hyperlinks

In order to create a link, we want to wrap text or other content within an **< a>** element and using the **href** attribute.

**href** = Hypertext Reference, or target that contains the url.

In order to make hyperlinks readable to all readers, we want to have link text. We don't want to:

- say "link" or "links to".
- keep link text short.

## CSS Layout

**Normal Flow** - the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't touched their layout.

### block-level and inline Elements

**block-level** - content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it.

- Appear on new lines.

**inline** - the size of their content.

- Do not appear on new lines. All sit on same line.

### Positioning

**position** - Allows you to take elements out of normal document flow and make them behave differently.

- **static positioning** - The default that every element gets. Put the element into its normal position in the document flow.

**absolute** position: 

- We can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

- An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow.

**fixed** vs **absolute** positioning - absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

## JS Functions

**functions** - allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command

### Invocation Vs. Declaration

**invocation** - to use a function after it has been defined we have to run or call it.

> Ex: myFunction();

**declaration** - establishes the names and characteristics of a function.

### Parameter Vs. Argument

**parameter** - the variable inputs that you use in the function definition. Values that need to be included inside the parentheses.

**argument** - actual values or expressions used when calling the function.

## Pair Programming

**Learning From Fellow Students**: Often times developers in a pair can have different skill sets resulting in them teaching eachother.

- This can and has actually helped me already in these courses.

**Job Interview Readiness** - The ability to work with and learn from others combined with great social skills are important to a company. Pair programming strengthens these skills.

## Things I Want To Know More About

Overall, I'm just wanting to understand functions. I feel like I have an alright understanding currently.
