# Chart.js, Canvas

[JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

## HTML5 Canvas Element

HTML5 features the < canvas> element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

The < canvas> element requires at least two attributes: width and height that specify the size of the canvas.

### Fallback content

Unlike the < img> element, The < canvas> element requires the closing tag </>. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the < canvas> element.

## getContext

Returns a drawing context on the canvas, or null if the context identifier is not supported, or the canvas has already been set to a different context mode.
