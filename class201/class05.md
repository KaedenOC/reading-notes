# Images, Color, Text, and More Work With Functions

Without a **src** attribute, an img element has no image to load.

the **alt** attribute is a textual description of the image. If the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render, the text will show the user text.

Captions and alt text have distinct roles. Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas alt text provides the same functionality as an absent image.

**figure** - could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video, equations, a table, or something else.

**SVG** - Ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams, etc., that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.

**GIF** - Simple images and animations.  GIF was one of the first two graphics formats supported by HTML

**Screenshots** - Should use a lossless format, PNG is best bet but WebP for better compression.

## More CSS

The **color** property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the **background-color** property defines the element's background color. These can be used on just about any element.
