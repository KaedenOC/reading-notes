## Importance of Semantic Elements

We use semantic elements to make sure we are giving our content the correct meaning.

> Note: The semantic value of an element also will be used by SEO and screen readers.

## Levels of Headings

There are six levels of headings. The h1 element is the highest level heading which consists of the MAIN heading. The rest represent subheadings by importance.

## Uses For sup and sub

**superscript** and **subscript** are used for things like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations.
