# Lists, The Box Model, and Loops

## Unordered Lists / Ordered Lists

**Ordered Lists** - typically a 
numbered list represents an ordered list of numbers.

**Unordered List** - list with no specific order, typically bulleted.

> Note: Typically want to use an **unordered list** when grouping data that does not go in a certain order. Use the **ordered list** when you are displaying a meaningful order.

### Changing The Bullet Style

Use the **list-style-type** property to change the styling of bullet style.

### Changing The Number Style of OL

Use the **start** attribute to start counting from a different integer from the list.

Use **type** attribute to set the numbering type.

> Note: a, A, i, I, and 1

## CSS Box Model

EVERYTHING HAS A BOX AROUND IT

**margin** - outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border.

**padding** - around the content.

### Standard CSS Box Model

**inline-size**, **block-size**, **width**, and **height**.

Add padding and border to get the total size taken up by the box.

## JavaScript Arrays, Operators, Expressions, Conditionals, and Loops

### Array

Store a list of data items under a single variable name.

**Data Types** in Arrays: strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.

const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

I believe this is a valid array. We can access the values using, a for...of statement.

## Shorthand Assignment Operators

**Assignment** - "=" assigns a value to a variable.

**Addition** - "+=" adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns result to the variable.

**Subtraction** - "-=" subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to variable.

**Multiplication** - "*=" multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to variable.

**Remainder** - "%=" divide a variable by the value of the right operand and assign the result to variable.

> Evaluate Expression: let a = 10; let b = "dog"; let c = false; (a + c) + b;
> I believe this evaluates to false.

## Loops

**Loops** - rapidly completes repetitive tasks.

Useful for using less repeat code to get end result, and loops can run slightly different code, or the same code but with different variables.
