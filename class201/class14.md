# CSS Transitions and Transforms

[CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

Translate: Move an element along the X and/or Y axis.
Rotate: Rotate an element clockwise or counterclockwise.
Scale: Increase or decrease the size of an element.
Skew: Distort an element along the X and/or Y axis.
Perspective: Create a 3D effect by adding depth to an element.
Multiple transforms: Combine multiple transforms to achieve complex effects.

To apply a CSS transform to an element, you can use the transform property in CSS, along with one or more transform functions.

## Transitions and Animations

[CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

There are four transition related properties in total, including **transition-property**, **transition-duratio**n, **transition-timing-function**, and **transition-delay**. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

Change the color, size, or position of an element smoothly over a specified duration.
Add hover effects, such as making an image appear to grow or change color when the user hovers over it.
Create animated menus, buttons, or other user interface elements that respond to user input.

CSS transitions are designed for simple, one-time effects, such as a hover effect on a button or a fade-in effect on an image. CSS animations, on the other hand, are better suited for more complex and continuous animations, such as an animated loading spinner or a looping animation of a character.

Improved user experience: Transitions can make your website feel more dynamic and interactive, providing users with visual feedback when they interact with elements. This can help improve the overall user experience and make your website more engaging.

## Long Term Goals

I have been curious about how developers add animation to websites for years now. Now that I have seen how to do it, I am excited to learn more about it and start adding animation into my work.
