# Debugging and Error Handling

[Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

## Types of Error

- **Syntax Error** - spelling errors in the code that cause the program not to run. Usually will provide error messages.
- **Logic Error** - syntax is correct but the code isn't what you intended it to be. It runs but gives incorrect results. Harder to fix, and usualy are no error messages.

### Personal Experience

I have encountered syntax errors many times so far and usually I  have been able to fix it by viewing the console log, seeing what line the error is on, and debugging that line.

In our most current lab, I had some logic errors, where the code was running with no error messages but providing me with a result that wasn't what I expected. This was a bit more difficult to figure out and so I actually needed some assistance with this.

I think that this topic will remain relevant throughout my coding journey because errors are going to happen. The better I get at being able to catch these errors and solve them properly will always be something to strive for.

## Debugging JavaScript

[JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load.

### Debugger

The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

> Note: **Chrome** - Open the Developer tools and then select the Sources tab.
