- Controversial project that was reported to have been developed by Google. The project involved the creation of a censored search engine for the Chinese market. China is known to be extensive, and such a search engine would reportedly filter out certain topics, websites, or search results that the Chinese government deems sensitive or undesirable. Many people, including human rights activists and some Google employees, expressed their disapproval of the project, as they believed it contradicted Google's stated commitment to openness and the free flow of information.

- One of the key ethical dilemmas in self-driving car technology is known as the "trolley problem." This thought experiment poses the question of what a self-driving car should do in a situation where it must make a split-second decision that could harm either its occupants or pedestrians. The ethical considerations in this scenario involve factors such as minimizing harm, preserving human life, ensuring fairness, and determining legal responsibility. There's every reason for excitement: Self-driving vehicles will ease commutes, returning lost time to workers; enhance mobility for seniors and those with physical challenges, and sharply reduce the more than 35,000 deaths on U.S. highways each year.
