# AWS CLoud Servers

## EC2 Instance:

[AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

An EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance is a virtual server in the cloud offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It provides resizable compute capacity in the form of virtual machines, allowing you to run applications and services in a flexible and scalable manner.

## EC2 Use Cases

- **Web Hosting**: EC2 instances can be used to host websites or web applications.
- **Big Data Processing**: EC2 instances are commonly used for processing large amounts of data.

**ECS** (Elastic Container Service) is a container orchestration service provided by AWS. One reason to choose ECS over services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com is the seamless integration with other AWS services.

## EC2 on the AWS Console

We can find the EC2 on the AWS Console under the computer area of services and it should be the first option.

- **T2 Micro** is the smallest instance type and is suitable for low-traffic websites, small applications, or development/testing purposes. Single vCPU (virtual CPU).

- **T2 XL** is a larger instance type with higher performance capabilities. It provides multiple vCPUs and more memory compared to the T2 Micro. Better suited for appliations that require more power or require heavier workloads.

**Compute cycle** is like a single step or task performed by a worker on the assembly line. Refers to the execution of a single instruction by a processor.

## What Is Elastic Beanstalk?

[Elastic Beanstalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrwxAScdyT0)

Fully managed service provided by AWS that makes it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications. *Automates* the process of deploying and managing applications in a variety of programming languages and environments.

When you deploy an application using Elastic Beanstalk, it automatically provisions the necessary EC2 instances, load balancers, and other resources required to run your application.

Benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk:

- **Easy Application Deployment** - simplifies the deployment process by providing a platform where you can upload your application code and configure the environment settings.

- **Scalability and High Availability** - can automatically scale your application based on the demand.

- **Monitoring and Diagnostics** - allows you to monitor the health and performance of your application. You can access logs, metrics, and other important information.

- **Integration with AWS Services** - integration enables you to leverage additional AWS resources and services to enhance your application's functionality.

I am looking forward to learning more about AWS, and also more on Elastic Beanstalk.
