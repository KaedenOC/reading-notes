# Event Driven Applications

[Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is called the "events" module. It provides a way to work with events and event emitters in Node.js.

- The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.

- Registering event listeners can actually reverse the flow of communication between our objects. Rather than on object needing to reach inside another object to trigger a function, our objects can just emit events and whichever objects are listening to those event will process it in the way they have been told to.

- **Event Driven Programming** in the web browser allows developers to respond to user interactions such as button clicks, mouse movements, or form submissions. Similarly, on the backend using Node.js, Event Driven Programming can be useful for handling various types of events, such as incoming HTTP requests, database operations, file system events, or network communication.

Looking forward to seeing and understanding trees this module.
