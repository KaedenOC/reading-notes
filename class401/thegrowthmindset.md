# The Growth Mindset

> *Growth Mindset* is a way of thinking about things in a positive light.

> Learn from your mistakes and keep pushing forward.

- I ~~CANT~~ **CAN** do this.

- I just need to practice and practice.

- Failure is a stepping stone to *SUCCESS*.

## The Power Of Yet

In Carol Dwecks "Growth Mindset" TED talk, I found the "Power of Yet" section interesting. I found that it correlates with me and my journey with Software Development, and being able to learn from errors and realize that I will eventually understand something.

> "I don't know this material YET, but I will be able to learn it".

## Emotional Intelligence

I ended up having scores of twenty for self-awareness, social awareness, and relationship awareness. My highest score came out to be twenty-five for the self-management category. I believe this to be pretty accurate for myself.

I have seen growth in self awareness, social awareness, and relationship awareness throughout my Code Fellows journey thus far.

## Biases

It looks like I scored a 100/120. This means I have high self-awareness, curiosity, and courage. One of my lower scores was Effective Courage, and I think this means I need to work on being able to speak up about how I'm doing or how I'm feeling. I think that this is pretty accurate. I'm definitely good at keeping to myself in a work environment. Especially because of my past work experience.

The lowest score I got was in the Four Ways To Act section. I was in the middle of each of these categories, and I believe that that is telling me that I don't like change as much. This is also something that I have been working on since starting Code Fellows. I have definitely made progress on this.
