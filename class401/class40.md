## Next.js

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js provides built-in server-side rendering capabilities, which allows you to render your React components on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client. SSR can improve performance and SEO because search engines can easily crawl and index the content.

- Next.js automatically performs code splitting, which means that it only sends the JavaScript code necessary to render a particular page to the client.

## Gatsby

- Static Site Generator (SSG): Gatsby.js is a powerful static site generator that combines React with GraphQL. It allows you to build static websites that are incredibly fast and efficient.

- Gatsby.js has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality and allow you to integrate various services and data sources easily. Plugins can be used for tasks like fetching data from CMS platforms, optimizing images, generating sitemaps, adding analytics, and much more.
