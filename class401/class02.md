[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

## Express, Middleware

- **Middleware** refers to software functions that sit between a web application's server and client, processing incoming requests, and generating responses.

- **Express** is the most popular web framework for NodeJS.

- Express is "unopinionated" which means it doesn't force developers to use any specific approach or coding style. You have many choices with Express.

- **Module** self-contained block of code that can be reused in different parts of a program.

- **Modularity** allows us to break down complex programs into smaller, more manageable parts. Readability, easier to debug code, and reuse code.

## NPM

- **NPM Version** - 9.6.4
