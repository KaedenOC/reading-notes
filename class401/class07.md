# Reading: Bearer Authorization

[Intro to JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

Compact and self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications and APIs.

- Typically used when a client needs to send information to a server and have the server verify the authenticity of that information.

- They can be used to authenticate and authorize access to protected resources, such as APIs or web services.

- Claims are expected to be included in the payload component of a JWT. The payload is a JSON object that contains the claims about the entity (usually a user) and additional metadata. User id, username, role, etc.

- When a JWT is signed using a secret key or a public/private key pair, the signature ensures the integrity of the token. If the signature is valid, it means the token has not been tampered with or modified since it was issued by the trusted party. So, while the payload can be decoded, the recipient must validate the signature to ensure the token's integrity and authenticity.

- When sending a JWT, both the sender and receiver must know the shared secret key. The secret key is used to generate the signature during token creation, and the same key is used by the receiver to verify the signature.

- Think of an envelope.. The content of the envelope represents the payload, which contains the information (claims) that need to be transmitted. The signature, which is generated by concatenating the encoded header, encoded payload, and the secret key, can be compared to the seal on the envelope.

- Good way to securely transmit information between parties. Solidifies the sender that they are who they are.

- Send info between two parties as an object

- **Endcoded Header** - contains information about the token, such as the token type (typ) and the cryptographic algorithm (alg) used for signing the token

- **Encoded Payload** - contains the claims or data that are being transmitted. It includes information such as the user ID, expiration time, and other relevant data.

- **Secret Key** - shared secret known by both the sender and the receiver. It is used to generate the signature and verify its authenticity.
