# React Native

[getting started with react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

## Core Components

- **View** - similar to the `<div>` element, and it is used to create a container that defines the layout and structure of the user interface. Views can be nested within each other to create complex UI structures.

- **Text** - used for rendering text content in the app. It is similar to the `<span>` or `<p>` element in web development. You can apply styling and formatting to the text within the Text component.

- **Image** - used to display images in the app. It supports various image formats and provides options for resizing, scaling, and styling the images.

## Why React Native?

**React Native** is called "native" because it allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React, while still providing a native-like user experience.

- allows developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms.

- components, state management, styling, and navigation are the building blocks of a React Native application.

## Expo

[expo](https://expo.dev/)

- set of tools and services built around React Native that simplifies the development workflow and eases the setup process.

- provides a development environment, pre-built components and APIs, and tools for building, testing, and publishing React Native apps.

- Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the **Managed** workflow.

- The main difference between React Native and Expo is that React Native is a framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript, while Expo is a set of tools and services that work on top of React Native to streamline the development process.

## Expo Snack

[expo snack](https://snack.expo.dev/)

- allows you to write and preview React Native code in the browser. It provides an interactive coding environment where you can quickly prototype, test, and share your React Native code without the need for local development setup.

**Eject** - refers to the process of transitioning an Expo project to a standard React Native project. When you eject you detach your project from the Expo framework, and it becomes a standalone React Native project. Provides more flexibility.

- might not eject when you want to leverage the benefits of Expo's managed workflow and the convenience it provides for building and deploying React Native apps. Adds complexity.

- might eject when you want to use any React Native library or module and customize your project to a greater extent, and custom native module integrations, access to advanced configuration options, performance optimizations, and the desire to have more control over the development process.
