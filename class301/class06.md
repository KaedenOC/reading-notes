# REST

[CodeFellows: How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers, that sent docs across the internet. He helped write HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). "HTTP is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns."

## What Is REST?

[Codeacademy - REST](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest)

- **REST** - REpresentational State Transfer - an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.

## GET, POST, PUT, PATCH

- **GET** - used to retrieve data from a web server.

- **POST** - method or request used to submit data to a web server to be processed and stored.

- **PUT** - method or request used to update or replace an existing resource on a web server.

- **PATCH** - method or request used to partially update an existing resource on a web server.
