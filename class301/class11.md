# MongoDB and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

- **SQL** - Relational Databases, table based databases, predefined schema, vertically scalable,  **structured query language**, not best fit for hierarchical data storage.

- **NoSQL** - primarily called as non-relational or distributed database, document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores, dynamic schema for unstructured data, horizontally scalable, queries are focused on collection of documents, **Unstructured Query Language**, not good fit for complex queries, fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## SQL

- SQL databases are a good fit for data that has a well-defined structure and relationships between tables.

- Real World Example: A business that has customers which contains information about the customers.

## NoSQL

- Good fit for unstructured or semi-structured data.

- Real world example: Social Media platform's user-generated content database, which contains posts, comments, and likes.

- **Hierarchical data storage** is best handled by a NoSQL database, specifically a document-oriented database.

- **N0SQL** - designed to scale horizontally, by adding more commodity servers, rather than vertically, by adding more powerful hardware. Handle large volumes of data and traffic without compromising performance.
