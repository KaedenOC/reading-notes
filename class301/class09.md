## What Is Functional Programming

- **Functional Programming** - programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs and evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- **Pure Function** - Always returns the same output given the same inputs and does not have any side effects.

- Examine the inputs, outputs, and whether or not the function causes observable side effects.

- **What are the benefits of a pure function?** - They are easier to reason about and test. (output of the function is solely dependent on its inputs).

- **Immutability** - Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. State cannot change after itâ€™s created.

- **Referral Transparency** - Property of a function that means the function can be replaced with its resulting value without changing the behavior of the program
