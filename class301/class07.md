## Pair Programming

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning From Fellow Students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work Environment Readiness

### Most Beneficial To Me

I have found that **"Engaged collaboration"**, **"Work Environment Readiness"**, and **"Learning From Fellow Students"** has been the most beneficial to me.

### How Does It Work?

Commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The **Driver** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The **Navigator** thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
