### What Is A Component?

A small piece of code that fills a certain part of the user interface that you're building with react.

- It is a software object, intended to interact with other components.

- It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

### Characteristics of Components

- **Reusability** - designed to be reused in different situations, and some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** - may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** - designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** - extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** - refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of a component from the outside world.

- **Independent** - designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
