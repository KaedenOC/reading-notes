# Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture

[Component Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

### What Is A Component?

A small piece of code that fills a certain part of the user interface that you're building with react.

- It is a software object, intended to interact with other components.

- It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

### Characteristics of Components

- **Reusability** - designed to be reused in different situations, and some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** - may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** - designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** - extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** - refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of a component from the outside world.

- **Independent** - designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### Advantages

- **Ease of deployment** - it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- **Reduced cost** - The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- **Ease of development** - allow the ability to implement well-known interfaces. Allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
