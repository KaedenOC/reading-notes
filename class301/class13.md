- Use the HTTP methods **PUT** or **PATCH** to update a record through an API. PUT is used for complete updates while PATCH is used for partial updates.

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are used to perform actions on resources in a RESTful API. In other words, RESTful APIs use CRUD operations to manipulate resources.

- Five steps to create a RESTful API:

1. Identify the resources.

2. Define the endpoints.

3. Choose the appropriate HTTP methods for each endpoint, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE.

4. Specify the data to be returned, JSON, XML.

5. Document the API.
